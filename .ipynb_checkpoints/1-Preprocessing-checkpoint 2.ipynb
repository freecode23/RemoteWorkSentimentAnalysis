      "1392271221761396740 2021-05-12 07:11:41 +0700 <mar15sa> @hnshah The thing about remote work is you choose where you work. It could be in an office, or it could be anywhere else.   So all of these answers could be for remote work, but only one of these answers is for traditional office work.    https://t.co/kcUSpRBBIp\n",
      "1392271163930423296 2021-05-12 07:11:27 +0700 <SheWrestlesTest> The company I work for has been fully remote since it‚Äôs inception a decade ago.

Rates are crazy low, and as long as more companies are switching to remote work, people are moving out to the burbs.   I'm lucky that my wife and I bought last year just as everything was shutting down. I can't imagine looking for a place right now.\n",
      "1392271110452891650 2021-05-12 07:11:14 +0700 <musingvirtual> @schuyler1d I agree that remote working is a more equitable and economical solution than hybrid for software companies. The hybrid companies I see work are remote-first, hybrid-second.  But outside the software industry there's often jobs that can't be remote, so hybrid is going to be needed\n",
