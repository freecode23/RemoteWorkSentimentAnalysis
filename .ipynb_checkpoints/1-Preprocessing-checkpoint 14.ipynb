This one will pose a challenge for leaders, especially given their concerns about maintaining culture: ‚Äú73% of those polled said their employees want permanent remote work.‚Äù  https://t.co/AkbmegxdWs via @cmswire\n",
      "1392271375801405447 2021-05-12 07:12:17 +0700 <nyychick> @madebyjuan @BostonGlobe Exactly. If you poll most people they‚Äôre enjoying a primarily remote work life. It‚Äôs like their bosses need to post the story to ‚Äúteach their employees a lesson‚Äù. Just doesn‚Äôt add up\n",
      "1392271221761396740 2021-05-12 07:11:41 +0700 <mar15sa> @hnshah The thing about remote work is you choose where you work. It could be in an office, or it could be anywhere else.   So all of these answers could be for remote work, but only one of these answers is for traditional office work.    https://t.co/kcUSpRBBIp\n",
      "1392271163930423296 2021-05-12 07:11:27 +0700 <SheWrestlesTest> The company I work for has been fully remote since it‚Äôs inception a decade ago.   We‚Äôre all highly functional connected humans, we don‚Äôt need to be physically present to be present with one another and hey, huge bonus, I manage my ADHD and PTSD symptoms better when remote.\n",
      "1392271156992901120 2021-05-12 07:11:25 +0700 <Skepti_Schism> I happen to work for a company where the hybrid workplace works just fine. The way to make it work is to ensure you consistently have live meetings to connect, have your remote workers come in occasionally, and offer incentives on both sides.\n",
      "1392271114789867527 2021-05-12 07:11:15 +0700 <SNicktendo> @heyyguido Probably not for a while. Rates are crazy low, and as long as more companies are switching to remote work, people are moving out to the burbs.   I'm lucky that my wife and I bought last year just as everything was shutting down. I can't imagine looking for a place right now.\n",
      "1392271110452891650 2021-05-12 07:11:14 +0700 <musingvirtual> @schuyler1d I agree that remote working is a more equitable and economical solution than hybrid for software companies. The hybrid companies I see work are remote-first, hybrid-second.  But outside the software industry there's often jobs that can't be remote, so hybrid is going to be needed\n",

      "1392270638006603776 2021-05-12 07:09:21 +0700 <BrianJRoan> Literally the last thing that I want is to feel I ‚Äúbelong‚Äù at an office. I am working in a remote team now that I‚Äôve never met and I‚Äôve never had easier working relationships because we have no distractions between us. It‚Äôs pure work.
